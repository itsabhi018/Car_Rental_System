# 🚗 Car Rental System (Java CLI Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Car Rental System** is a **Java-based Command Line Interface (CLI)** application developed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles**.  
This project simulates a real-world car rental service where users can rent and return cars through a menu-driven terminal interface.

The main goal of this project is to strengthen **Core Java** concepts and understand how OOP is applied in real applications.

- **Interface:** Command Line Interface (CLI)

### Java Concepts Used
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- Exception Handling
- Collections (ArrayList)

## 🧩 OOP Concepts Implementation

### 1️⃣ Encapsulation
Each class uses private variables with public getter and setter methods to protect data.

### 2️⃣ Abstraction
Important behaviors are exposed while hiding implementation details to keep the design clean.

### 3️⃣ Inheritance
Common properties and methods are reused using inheritance to avoid code duplication.

### 4️⃣ Polymorphism
Methods behave differently depending on the object type, making the system flexible and extensible.

### 5️⃣ Exception Handling
Custom and built-in exceptions handle invalid input and runtime errors gracefully.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Add user authentication (login and registration)
- Store car and rental data using file handling or a database
- Create an admin panel to manage cars and rentals
- Add pricing rules, discounts, and promo codes
- Improve validation and error handling
- Convert the CLI application into a GUI using JavaFX or Swing

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
- Gained a strong understanding of Core Java concepts
- Learned practical implementation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Improved problem-solving and logical thinking skills
- Understood how real-world systems can be modeled using Java classes
- Learned exception handling and input validation
- Gained experience building a complete CLI-based application
